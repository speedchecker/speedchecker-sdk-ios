- robust measuring of cellular, wireless, even local network
- testing details like the current speed and progress
- additional information like network type and location (see KPI list below in FAQ)
- included high-capacity servers provided and maintained by [Speedchecker](https://www.speedchecker.com) or custom servers

## Requirements
  - Xcode 13.3.1 or later

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

1. File > Add Packages...
2. Add `https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios`
3. Select "Up to Next Major" with "2.2.8"

### CocoaPods

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'SpeedcheckerSDK'
end
```

### Manually

1. Place the `SpeedcheckerSDK.xcframework` and all other frameworks from [Framework folder](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios/tree/master/Framework) into your Xcode project. We recommend you to copy it rather than to reference from an other location.
2. In your application target, go to the _General tab_, section _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_, and set "Embed & Sign" for all added frameworks.
3. Go to _Build Phases_ tab and recheck itâ€™s added in _Link Binary With Libraries_ and also in the _Embedded Frameworks_ section.

 Now the SpeedcheckerSDK framework should be importable to your code.
#### Swift
```swift
import SpeedcheckerSDK
```

## FAQ

**Is the SDK free to use?**

Yes! But the SDK collects data on network performance from your app and shares it with Speedchecker and our clients. Free SDK version requires enabled location. Those restrictions are not in Basic and Advanced versions

**Do you have Android SDK?**

Yes! Please take a look at this [repo](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-android)

**Do you support integration into apps developed using cross-platform frameworks?**

Yes! We support [Flutter](https://github.com/speedchecker/flutter_plugin), [React Native](https://github.com/speedchecker/react_plugin) and [Cordova](https://github.com/speedchecker/cordova_plugin)

**Do you provide free support?**

No, we provide support only on Basic and Advanced plans

**What are all the metrics or KPIs that you can get using our SDKs?**

iOS does not provide as many capabilities to collect network and device KPIs as Android does. Here are some of the KPIs which can be retrieved using our iOS SDK:

| iOS KPI list |
| ------------- |
| Download / Upload / Latency |
| Device Model |
| Measurement server used |
| Geolocation Accuracy |
| Latitude & Longitude |
| WiFi / Cellular connection type |
| Cellular type (e.g. 4G/3G) |
| Indication if device is charging |
| ISP |
| ASN |
| IP Address |

[Full list of our KPIs](https://docs.speedchecker.com/measurement-methodology-links/u21ongNGAYLb6eo7cqjY/kpis-and-measurements/list-of-kpis)

**Do you host all infrastructure for the test?**

Yes, you do not need to run any servers. We provide and maintain network of high quality servers and CDNs to ensure the testing is accurate. If you wish to configure your own server, this is possible on Basic and Advanced plans.

**How do you measure the speed?**

See our [measurement methodology](https://docs.speedchecker.com/measurement-methodology-links/u21ongNGAYLb6eo7cqjY/kpis-and-measurements/data-collection-methodologies)
